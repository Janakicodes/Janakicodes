# Hi, I’m Janaki Balachandran 👋

Product Manager | Builder | Thinker

I’m passionate about transforming ideas into meaningful products that solve real problems , especially where **AI, user experience, and human-centered design intersect**. I write and speak about mental wellness, generative AI, leadership, and product execution while building tools that help teams and users work better.

## What I care about
- **Product Strategy & Delivery:** Turning ambiguous problems into structured solutions, aligning stakeholders, and shipping outcomes with impact.  
- **AI for People:** Exploring how generative AI can enhance productivity, emotional well-being, and workflows. 
- **Human Experience:** Understanding how people interact with technology and shaping experiences that feel intuitive and meaningful.

## What I’m building
This GitHub reflects the intersection of my product practice and hands-on prototyping. Expect to see:
- **Tools that embody product principles** — small, focused, and delightful  
- **AI-driven helpers** built with a human-first lens  
- **Documentation and case studies** on product thinking  
- **Samples of workflows and automation** I use day-to-day
